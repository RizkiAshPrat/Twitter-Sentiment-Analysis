2402,0,So I spent a few hours making something for fun. . . If you don't know I am a HUGE @Borderlands fan and Maya is one of my favorite characters. So I decided to make myself a wallpaper for my PC. . Here is the original image versus the creation I made :) Enjoy! pic.twitter.com/mLsI5wf9Jg
2404,0,that was the first borderlands session in a long time where i actually had a really satisfying combat experience. i got some really good kills
2405,1,the biggest dissappoinment in my life came out a year ago fuck borderlands 3

2407,1,Man Gearbox really needs to fix this dissapointing drops in the new Borderlands 3 DLC cant be fine to farm bosses on Mayhem 10 to get 1 legendary drop while anywhere else i get 6-10 drops. . Really sucks alot
2410,1,why does like every man in borderlands have slicked back hair haven’t you heard of bangs you stupid assholes
2412,0,Going to finish up Borderlands 2 today. I've got some new commands set up and am looking forward to a good stream! Starting in about am hour!
2413,0,imma probably play some borderlands tps in a bit . that'll be fun
2415,0,FUCK YESSSSSSSS . 
2417,1,Grounded almost looked pretty cool even despite the borderlands tier unfunny writing until it became yet another survival crafting game. I really can’t wait for this shitty trend to die
2419,1,@Borderlands how do I submit a complaint? Your CEO isn't paying his staff their bonuses.
2420,1,All the Borderlands are fuckin trash
2421,0,"Finally played through borderlands 3. The actual game play is great. Almost all guns feel fun, and I never once felt like I needed to grind. That story on the other hand.... All I will say Is that I'm very much so looking forward to the eventual cutscene skip :)"

2434,1,fuck it .  pic.twitter.com/Wav1bacr5j
2435,0,Borderlands 2 is so good omg
2437,1,@Borderlands something seems very broken with M10 drop rates. Constantly dropping less lot than lower mayhem levels. How is this possible with a +2500% loot modifier on. I swear I'm seeing more greens and blues than anything on boss kills.
2439,0,I got to play Borderlands 2 with the entire polycule tonight. It was fun and magical. The the evening had to end. *sigh*.
2440,1,This is shitty. I get that profit-wise it was less than expected due to a huge budget.
2441,0,Borderlands 3 is good so far but Borderlands 2 will always be the fav

2448,0,Bc all those games are okay this borderlands is the best of its kind
2450,0,The next one is Borderlands: The Handsome Collection. You're welcome
2451,0,I disagree. Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck is a wonderful end to the borderlands 3 dlc line that focuses on a fan favorite character and gives long lasting players closure on some very big questions of Krieg’s character and memorable set pieces players interact with.
2452,1,I hate this algorithm
2453,0,"This April patch + mini DLC for Borderlands 3 is amazing. The events, the new difficulty modifiers, the ramp up in gear stats, all combine to make the game fresh yet again."
2454,0,"Hey guys! @Optus appears to have had an accident just as the stream was getting good! As an apology I'll be back tomorrow for MORE borderlands! Once again, big apologies, no idea what happened!  "

1920,1,@CallofDuty y’all really fucked up Black Ops Cold War lmao get ready for a flop
1921,1,This shit is about to be so hard isn’t it
1922,1,Can we keep warzone as the COD br and consistently update that and then just focus on multiplayer for this year pls. Multiplayer is now suffering because of the focus on br in the last two games

1939,1,Say goodbye to your 825 GB on PS5. It’s all gonna be gone after this
1940,1,Beautiful graphics - I loved the first Black Ops.
1941,1,Fuck this game already
1942,1,my pc is crying
1943,0,The menu looks so nice. I just dont understand why people thought CW would gets its own BR. They literally said its going to cross over to Warzone. The Cold War coming. . . .. .. .. .  
1944,1,@Treyarch any possibility of updating blackout to be cross platform? It doesn’t even have to be on the new game. I think it would be a great idea for people not into warzone. A ton of bigger streamers also prefer it.  
1945,0,"Lowkey hyped for cold war, campaign is something i cant wait to play! Who else is hyped!?  "
1946,1,Let's hope @Treyarch do something to remove the racist and hateful language in Black Ops Cold War since @InfinityWard don't seem to give a shit

7754,1,Lmao so sad
7755,1, 
7756,1,@EAMaddenNFL It wouldent hurts to give offensive line men X factors it could almost be like momentum shift but how you get them into the zone is by not letting their quarterback get sacked or consecutive played without taking a loss of yards just throwing my opinion out there
7757,1,I hate that I need to get Madden now
7758,1,Stop playing . 
7759,1,How do you give @AaronRodgers12 an 89 overall? @EAMaddenNFL get your shit together!

9067,0,"If @nvidia acquires ARM, what I want to see is big.LITTLE graphics cards where desktop apps are handled by a very low power ARM GPU on the same board as the RTX GPU for other programs. This way at idle, the GPU uses very low power and generates virtually no heat with fans off."
9068,1,Looks like we're all switching to AMD gpu's this fall because nvidia can't produce more than 13 3080's for North America

9170,1,It’s like @nvidia wants us to buy @AMDGaming . I wanted to buy the rtx 2080 for months sold out is seconds @NVIDIAGeForce said they would fix this problem. They release the rtx 3090 and it’s sold out before launch... how can you be the biggest gpu supplier and not think of stock?

9191,1,@NVIDIAGeForce The hell with you Nvidia. You all wanted this launch to happen like it did. Triggering people to impulse buy so you brag about record sales in your next quarterly round up. Holding back your card so you can save bins for the 3070 to counter AMD's offer. Assholes.
9193,0,Love EVERYTHING about it .
