2437,2,@Borderlands something seems very broken with M10 drop rates. Constantly dropping less lot than lower mayhem levels. How is this possible with a +2500% loot modifier on. I swear I'm seeing more greens and blues than anything on boss kills.

1920,2,@CallofDuty y’all really fucked up Black Ops Cold War lmao get ready for a flop
1921,2,This shit is about to be so hard isn’t it
1922,2,Can we keep warzone as the COD br and consistently update that and then just focus on multiplayer for this year pls. Multiplayer is now suffering because of the focus on br in the last two games
1923,2,"Black Ops Cold War is definitely a step down from Modern Warfare. There's no double time or leaning, it feels dated, the gunplay is slow, the sounds are meh and weak in comparison."

1943,3,The menu looks so nice. I just dont understand why people thought CW would gets its own BR. They literally said its going to cross over to Warzone. The Cold War coming. . . .. .. .. .  
1944,2,@Treyarch any possibility of updating blackout to be cross platform? It doesn’t even have to be on the new game. I think it would be a great idea for people not into warzone. A ton of bigger streamers also prefer it.  
1945,3,"Lowkey hyped for cold war, campaign is something i cant wait to play! Who else is hyped!?  "
1946,2,Let's hope @Treyarch do something to remove the racist and hateful language in Black Ops Cold War since @InfinityWard don't seem to give a shit

1965,1,Black Ops Cold War’s campaign has gone under multiple different rewrites. So many missions have been reworked/changed/cancelled. The original script wasn’t at all related to Black Ops and they threw that all in after Treyarch took over.

7927,1,@EAMaddenNFL @EA I am glad we are getting some patches for the game especially franchise. We need more. Even bringing back previously available functions( i.e. stadium creator) from Madden games of the past. I hope you guys make enough improvements to make this game feel worth it
7928,1,"Looks great.  Unfortunately, you will never see this.  Game publishers appear to be getting away from TV/network Presentations.  And I understand the reasons why.  Still sad though."
7929,2,@EA @EAMaddenNFL The recent announcement that EA has locked up another long term contract with the @NFL is remarkably disrespectful to the fans that have been with Madden for 20 years. Allow competition. Madden is no longer the quality it once was.

7992,2,@EAMaddenNFL Why don’t you create a inactivity feature online that concedes games after two delays of game by the guy you’re playing when you’re beating them senseless. Nobody waits 25 min to get 50 Xp points for a win when the loser is taking penalties back to their goal line
7993,3,Derwin James is the best safety on this list. Don’t @ me.
